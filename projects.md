### chef_utensils

A Ruby gem containing boilerplate code to add common Rake tasks Chef cookbook project's `Rakefile`.
When you have multiple Chef cookbooks - each in their separate repository - this aims to remove the practice of
copy-pasting boilerplate code to and from each project while promoting best practices for Chef cookbook development.

The name is attempting to deliver yet another cooking pun to the Chef ecosystem - perhaps a poor attempt.

The project is ongoing.

### Open Austin's Harris County Bookings Data Gathering

A Python serverless project that aims to accumulate the information from Harris County's daily JIMS 1058 reports
into a format easily searchable for non-profit organizations looking for research information across a span of time
larger than the single day that the initial reports cover.
The project is designed to make the information accessible without jeopardizing the privacy of the people in the
booking reports.

The project is a part of the efforts of Open Austin, the Austin brigade of Code for America advocating for open
government and open data. As a result, a serverless approach was taken using AWS Lambda to keep costs down.

The project is ongoing.

### Why82?

A Ruby on Rails application that is designed to help filter the 1,230 games in a NBA season and find the games that are
worth watching. The idea is to highlight games that will be important and entertaining while ignoring the games that are
likely to be one-sided blowouts involving lackluster teams.

The project is currently in alpha and isn't intended for public consumption.
