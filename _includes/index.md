# Projects

## Why 82?
A web project highlighting which games in the NBA’s busy 1,230-game schedule (30 teams, 82 games each) are worth actually watching. The idea is to find games that should be entertaining while ignoring games that are more likely to be one-sided blowouts involving lackluster teams.

## chef_utensils
A Ruby gem containing boilerplate code to add common Rake tasks to a Chef cookbook project’s Rakefile. The name is attempting to deliver yet another cooking pun to the Chef ecosystem - perhaps a poor attempt.

## Harris County Bookings Data Gathering
